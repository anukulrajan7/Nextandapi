# Project Name

This project is a web application built using Next.js, MongoDB, Nodemailer, Next.js middleware, React Tailwind CSS, and React Hot Toast. It provides functionality for user authentication and various user-related operations.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is as follows:

```
- api
  - users
    - me
      - route.ts
    - signup
      - route.ts
    - resetpassword
      - route.ts
    - verifyemail
      - route.ts
    - login
      - route.ts
- pages
  - login
    - index.js
  - signup
    - index.js
  - resetpassword
    - index.js
  - verifyemail
    - index.js
- ...
```

The project consists of two main folders: `api` and `pages`.

The `api` folder contains various API endpoints related to user operations. Inside the `api/users` folder, you can find separate folders for different user routes, such as `me`, `signup`, `resetpassword`, `verifyemail`, and `login`. Inside each route folder, you can find a `route.ts` file that contains the logic for the corresponding API endpoint.

The `pages` folder contains the different pages of the application. Each page has its own folder, such as `login`, `signup`, `resetpassword`, and `verifyemail`. Inside each folder, you can find an `index.js` file, which represents the main file for that page.

You can add additional folders and files as per your project requirements.
